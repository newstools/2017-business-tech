Financial research group, Powerstocks has released a set of graphs showing a mass exodus of international investors from the JSE.&#8220;Since the September 2013 foreign-flows peak &#8211; achieved two months before SA fell into a business cycle recession &#8211; foreigners have dumped an unprecedented net R286 billion in SA equities and government bonds,&#8221; said Dwaine van Vuuren, CEO of Powerstocks.&#8220;JSE shares accounted for 74% of the outflows which brings the total rolling annual (12-month) outflows to R163 billion,&#8221; he said.Van Vuuren specifically noted that while emerging markets have experienced outflows within the last few years, these have been isolated to China. In fact, emerging markets as a group have experienced inflows for every quarter since the end of the financial crises in 2009.According to van Vuuren, the majority of the money lost by South Africa could have been prevented as they were primarily caused by factors well within the country&#8217;s control.He cited the following eight reasons why international outflows had increased so drastically, based on factors cited by international ratings agencies.The graphs below outline outflows over the past 12 monthsRead: Nando s could be heading to the stock market: report
