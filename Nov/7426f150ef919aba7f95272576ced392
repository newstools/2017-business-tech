Entrenching their mark as the best customer service providers in their field, Samsung now offers a door-to-door repair service for all its appliances and electronics. The tech giant recently launched Samsung Service Vans to ensure their customers receive a fast and effective same day repair to their products. “Customer and client retention are core functions for any successful business, especially those operating in a free market where trends can change overnight. Consistency and innovation are mantras practiced daily. But to truly set yourself apart, one needs to offer the highest standard of customer service, because no matter how good your product is, if you do not offer quality support services to your clients, you are bound to fail as an organisation,” says Director at Samsung South Africa Service, Richard Chetty. The service has rolled out in Johannesburg, Durban and Cape Town, with a view to extending the offering to other major centres in the near future. To book a repair, customers need to contact the call centre where they’ll be taken through a trouble-shooting exercise. For televisions, the issue can often be solved remotely. The service vans are kitted out with parts and equipment to solve the most common issues people experience and once the basic problem is established, a service van is dispatched. Currently, customers can expect a van to arrive the next day, but Samsung are planning on offering a same-day service soon. “People buy our products because they trust our brand. So, it’s only right that we return that trust by giving them the best customer service we can. We want to ensure that all our clients receive the care they need and expect of us. This innovation places us at the helm of rewarding our customers’ trust, because we understand that growing a business means growing you clientele’s confidence in you,” concludes Chetty.
