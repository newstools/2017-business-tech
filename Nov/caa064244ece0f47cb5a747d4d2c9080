The UK Government has announced new plans to encourage the best international technological, art, scientific and research talent to work in the UK. The announcements, which were made in the UK’s 2017 Autumn Budget, will directly impact Tier 4 Students and Tier 1 Exceptional Talent visa holders. The hope is that these changes will benefit the current and future leaders in the digital technology, science, arts and creative sectors, said immigration consultants Breytenbachs. “The Autumn Budget announced that legislation is in the pipeline to make it possible for highly skilled students to apply for work directly after finishing their degrees,” said Breytenbachs. “These changes will allow a student to switch to a Tier 2 skilled worker visa directly after finishing their studies, and not upon receipt of the degree, which reportedly can take months in some instances.” “There will also be changes to the labour market test. These changes will make it easier to hire overseas researchers and members of established research teams,” it said. Costs According to a report by TopUniversities, international undergraduate tuition fees vary considerably, starting at around £10,000 (R183,868) and going up to £35,000 (R643,538) or more for medical degrees. At all levels, humanities and social sciences degrees tend to cost the least, while laboratory and clinical degree programs are markedly more expensive. When combining these fees with the average cost of living in the UK, around £12,000 (R220,641), the total average cost of studying in the UK comes up to at least £22,000 (R404,509) per year. However it is important to note that a number of bursary and scholarships are available which could lead to significantly decreased fees, and in some cases no tuition costs at all.
