Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: 
Will all nine provinces  having completed their provincial general councils, Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa is currently leading the nominations for the ANC presidency.  However, Dlamini-Zuma has the support of the biggest provinces, who are sending more delegates to the fiercely-contested conference. While each branch gets to nominate – some branches get more than one vote. The bigger the branch, the more delegates it can send to the conference. The conference is set to begin on 16 December.
Communications Committee chair Humphrey Maxegwana has indicated that Parliament would consider an inquiry into damaging allegations about MultiChoice’s recent conduct. MultiChoice is battling claims that it bought influence over government policy on encryption for its digital migration project by paying the SABC and former Gupta-owned TV station ANN7.
Public protector Busi Mkhwebane has recommended that President Jacob Zuma task the special investigations unit (SIU) with probing the expenditure of R300 million for memorial services following former president Nelson Mandela’s funeral. Her recommendations include that the finance minister set out guidelines for state funerals and that the national treasury cost the entire event before funds are released.
The Department of Telecommunications has said it will establish its WOAN in South Africa. The government’s plans for the wholesale open access network have come under fire from industry players, who said spectrum allocated to the network should rather be given to established network operators – which will make better use of it.
South Africa’s rand strengthened on Monday on hopes that Ramaphosa will win the race to become the next leader of the ANC at a party conference. On Tuesday the rand was at R13.51 to the dollar, R18.19 to the pound, and R16.03 to the euro.
