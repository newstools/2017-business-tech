Online travel booking website Travelstart on Wednesday (6 December) announced that it has bought a majority stake in Cape Town-based SafariNow.com, for an undisclosed fee. SafariNow is an accommodation booking website which represents accommodation over both the informal (self-catering and vacation rentals) and formal sector (hotels, guesthouses, bed and breakfasts). The acquisition of SafariNow’s 40-man team sees Travelstart fast-track the growth of its accommodation offering, it said in a statement. “We want to supercharge our accommodation offering and with more than 23,000 listings on SafariNow, we can give our customers much better choices,” said Travelstart’s founder and CEO Stephan Ekbergh. SafariNow.com, founded in 1999, will stick to its core business of selling accommodation and retain its current brand, CEO and team. “Travelstart shares our mission of transforming the travel-booking experience to be simple and powerful,” said Tom Williams, CEO of SafariNow. “We’ve booked millions of bed-nights in the past 18 years and we’re excited to tackle this next chapter with a strong, supportive partner.” Travelstart and SafariNow started operations in South Africa in 1999 and are established players in Africa’s online travel booking industry. SafariNow will continue to run as a standalone business. Read: You may have been ripped off on your Black Friday travel deals
