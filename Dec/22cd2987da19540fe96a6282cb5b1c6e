A year on from showing the I-Pace Concept at the LA Auto Show, Jaguar went back to Los Angeles with a production prototype for final range and durability tests ahead of its official global reveal in 2018. According to  its website, the I‑Pace Concept will bring Jaguar performance to electric vehicles. “Available from the second half of 2018, our first electric vehicle will deliver 700Nm instant torque, 294kW and 0‑100km/h in around 4 seconds,” it said. And although still under the camouflage wraps, potential local customers can place a deposit or register a strong interest in the anticipated electric SUV by clicking on the ‘I want one’ button on www.jaguar.co.za. Jaguar engineers took the vehicle on a long range test drive. The I-Pace production prototype reached 200 miles (322 kilometres) from Sunset Boulevard, Los Angeles, to Morro Bay, San Luis Obispo, on a single charge of its Lithium-Ion battery. Ian Hoban, Jaguar vehicle line director, said: “After 1.5 million global test miles, the I-Pace is ready for production and is proven to deliver long distances on a single charge. Jaguar’s first battery electric vehicle will also be fast to charge; our target is a zero to 80% charge being achievable in a short break.” Full specification and pricing for Jaguar’s electric performance SUV will be announced late in 2018 when order books will officially open in South Africa.
