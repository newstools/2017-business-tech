The latest survey from Kantar Public shows that support for Cyril Ramaphosa, as the most popular candidate for president of the ANC among metro residents, is on the increase. The political party is expected to hold its electoral conference later this month. To gauge support for candidates for the National Elective Conference at the end of the year, respondents were asked ‘to what extent they would support’ certain candidates to be the president of the ANC. In the previous survey (August 2017), Ramaphosa was the most popular candidate with 36% of all respondents supporting him. In this latest survey, this has risen to 43%, with support also on the rise across the racial spectrum with 55% from black and 17% from white, indian and coloured people in the metro areas of South Africa. Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma remains in second place, but has seen a drop in support from 19% down to 15% followed by Matthews Phosa at 12%. “The drop in support for Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma may be linked to the deteriorating support for President Jacob Zuma, with only 15% of respondents agreeing that he is ‘doing a good job as president’, down from 18% in August 2017 and a high of 58% in November 2009,” Kantar said.
