Creative Media Works, operating as BBM Messenger, has partnered with Uber to launch an Uber ride-on-demand service within BBM Messenger. Users around the world will have access to this new service, including Indonesia – BBM’s largest market – Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and the Middle East. The tie-up means that BBM Messenger users – both Android and iOS – can book an Uber ride via the Uber icon in the BBM Discover menu, without leaving the BBM app or having to have the stand-alone Uber app on their phone. When launched from the Discover menu, the new Uber service asks riders to sign in with their mobile number or connect with a social media account. Once riders log in, the service accesses their profile and settings, automatically detects their location, and loads a map. Riders simply enter their destination, tap the Request Uber button as well as payment option, and wait for their ride to arrive.
