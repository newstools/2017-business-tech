President Jacob Zuma’s friend, Dudu Myeni, has landed a job as advisor to the minister of transport, Joe Maswanganyi, which will see her earn as much as R1 million a year, the Sunday Times reports. Maswanganyi confirmed and defended the appointment to the paper, saying that he needed an aviation expert on his team, and Myeni was highly recommended. The move comes as there is talk that the failing South African Airways may be moved from the department of public enterprises and National Treasury to the department of transport. If this comes to be, Myeni could once again be in a position to have a strong influence on the airline. Myeni is widely blamed for SAA’s financial and administrative woes, having been accused of widespread mismanagement at the airline – firing executives who did not agree with her, signing off on overpriced contracts, and generally running the group into the ground. She overstayed her welcome as chair of SAA by at least a year, and was only finally ousted in November this year, as lenders called in billions of rands owed to them. According to the Sunday Times, South Africa’s big banks have sent notice that should the move go ahead to put SAA in the transport portfolio (and thus within reach of Myeni), they will recall R8 billion in loans. SAA already faces a R9 billion loan repayment in March 2018, and has already received several multi-billion bailouts from government.
