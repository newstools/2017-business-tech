The World Economic Forum has published an infographic, compiled by Cumulus Media, showing how many emails, tweets and other types of transactions took place in a minute online. According to the WEF, the sheer scale of the online space is too big for anyone to truly grasp – be it over 2 billion people connected to Facebook, or the billions of emails that are sent every day. To get a better sense of the scale of the internet, Cumulus Media broke down what happens online in a minute.  According to the WEF, the above infographic lays out exactly why it is incredibly difficult to get your voice hear online and even in business, as there are just so many messages coming through that most get drowned out. It also explains the rise of the so-called ‘influencers’ and the adoption of different marketing techniques to reach audiences. “If you’ve ever had a post on Facebook or Instagram fizzle out, it’s safe to say that the above proliferation of content in our social feeds is part of the cause,” it said. “In a social media universe where there are no barriers to entry and almost infinite amounts of competition, the content game has tilted to become a “winner take all” scenario. Since people don’t have the time to look at the 452,200 tweets sent every minute, they naturally gravitate to the things that already have social proof.” “People look to the people they trust to see what’s already being talking about, which is why influencers are more important than ever to marketers,” the WEF said.
