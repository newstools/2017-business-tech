In November, Uber announced that it had partnered with retailer Checkers to make a number of its convenience meals and household essentials available to order on the UberEATS app. The partnership initially extends only to Checkers Sea Point and Kloof Street in Cape Town, to those within a 3.5km delivery radius of those stores, with Uber stating that additional stores are expected to be added in the future. “You can order anything from briquettes, firelighters, Steakhouse Classic rump, Championship Boerewors, Ready-to-Braai oepsies, garlic bread, pork belly sosaties, and even dessert delivered straight to your door,” said Uber South Africa spokesperson, Samantha Allenberg. Checkers said it it has also made a selection of alcohol from its LiquorShop available on the app. Allenberg said that the partnership was another step towards changing the food delivery industry in South Africa under Uber. “UberEATS already offers products beyond meals, such as the partnership with Food Lovers which offers users the opportunity to order a meal kit – comprising fresh ingredients and an easy-to-follow recipe from the country’s largest specialist fresh produce retailer – and have it delivered at Uber speed,” she said. “You can also order general grocery items from selected Checkers, Food Lovers and Woolworths stores. “Our aim has always been to innovate and evolve the food delivery industry and these type of partnership has enabled us to do just that.” Read: Why Uber is here to stay – despite the taxi violence
