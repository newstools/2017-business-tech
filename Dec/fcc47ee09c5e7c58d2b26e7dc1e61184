Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: 
The race to be the next ANC president is heating up between deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa and MP Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. Following the provincial general councils, and two weeks before the elections, the branch nominations have Ramaphosa on 1,278 votes and Dlamini-Zuma on 800.
 
The conference could also see a number of other changes made to the ANC, with the Gauteng branch calling for additional deputy president and deputy secretary general positions in the party. The Gauteng ANC’s Nkenke Kekana said that these extra leadership positions will strengthen Luthuli House and help to better monitor and implement ANC policies.
 
The sale of a portion of the government’s stake in Telkom is now back on the table says Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba. While government had previously indicated that it intended to sell its 39% stake, valued at about R13 billion, it is now looking to cover only the cost of the recapitalisation of the South African Post Office, which received a transfer of R3.7 billion in October.
 
New police commissioner Khehla Sitole has confirmed that he will move ahead with the relaunch of Operation Fiela to help combat crime. Other proposals mooted by the commissioner include the acknowledgement of specific “crime hotspots” and continuous lifestyle audits for all police officials.
 
South Africa’s rand firmed on Friday, ending the week up more than 3% against the dollar, as data signalled the domestic economy was on the mend. On Monday the rand was at R13.77 to the dollar, R18.55 to the pound, and R16.35 to the euro.
