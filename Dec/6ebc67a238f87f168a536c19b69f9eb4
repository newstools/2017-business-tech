Independent data journalists, Passmark, has released a new report on the most popular public high schools and primary schools in the Gauteng region. The report which was compiled by veteran journalists Alastair Otter and Laura Grant, is based on the number of applications received by each school when Gauteng’s online registration system opened for late applications for grades one and eight for the 2018 school year on 1 November. “By November, 402 schools had “received applications beyond their capacity” and were not available for late applications, Panyaza Lesufi, the head of Gauteng’s Education Department (GDE), said in a media statement when the online registration system opened again for late applications,” said Passmark. “According to Lesufi, by 1 November, 98,928 of next year’s grade 8s had been placed in a school. Incredibly, 40,292 applications – 40% of the number that have been placed – were submitted to just 34 high schools.” “Each of those high schools received more than 1,000 applications for grade 8. The combined capacity of those 34 schools was just over 8,300, according to the GDE. So more than 20,000 parents who applied to one of those schools at the beginning of this year would have been turned down and their child offered a place in another school,” it said. High Schools Primary schools In contrast to the high schools, only three primary schools got more than 1,000 applications each for grade 1 by November: Laerskool Akasia, Laerskool Theresapark and Bryanston Primary School. These are the 20 Gauteng primary schools that had received the most applications for grade 1 by November 2017.
