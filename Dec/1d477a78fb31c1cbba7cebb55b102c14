Teraco has announced the completion of JB2-Bredell – Africa’s first hyperscale data centre. Owned and operated by Teraco, the data centre facility located in features over 24 MW of power and 6,000m² of technical deployment space and is the largest commercial data centre in operation in Africa. “This is another Teraco first as we broke the mould of traditional brick and mortar buildings, and opted for a warehouse-type build instead,” said Gys Geyser, head of infrastructure development, at Teraco. He said that Teraco designed the facility incorporating different elements of tiering solutions to ensure concurrent maintainability, with added enhancements to cover different levels of fault tolerance. “We were able to double the power and cooling capacity, using similar mission critical footprints gained from previous deployments.” Bredell is the fourth facility built by Teraco, which also has locations in Cape Town, Durban and Johannesburg (Isando). Current power provision totals 50MW with over 18 000m2 of white space.              Read: We saw what South Africa’s internet will look like in 5 years – and it’s incredible
