Vodacom says it has bulked up its network in anticipation of increased demand over the December holiday period. “Tourism experts are forecasting a bumper festive season this year and the mobile data traffic is likely to more than double in certain places as a result. For the 2016 festive season period, Vodacom’s data volumes increased by 50% across the country,” said Vodacom chief technology officer, Andries Delport. “We’ve been ramping up investment on the network in recent months to make sure that we are ready for the high traffic in December and January. To this end, we deployed 100 brand new mobile base station sites to provide coverage and capacity at key areas along the coast as well some inland destinations.” Delport said that Vodacom completed the deployment of a further 21 temporary base stations in key holiday destinations. “We have also upgraded the data capacity on 1 701 3G base stations and 535 4G sites across key provinces.” Vodacom said that for the six months ended September 2017, it invested R4 billion in the network. “Including the current period, capital expenditure across the group will total at R37 billion over a three year period, with R26 billion in South Africa alone, Delport said.
