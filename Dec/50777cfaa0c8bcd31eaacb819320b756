The Department of Energy has published the official petrol prices for December 2017 – with the increases higher than first anticipated, thanks to a weaker rand and higher oil prices. From Wednesday, 6 December, the price of petrol for all grades will increase by 71 cents a litre. The per litre price of diesel 0.05% sulphur and 0.005% sulphur will increase by 60 cents and 57 cents respectively. The price of illuminating paraffin – wholesale and Single Maximum National Retail price – will go up by 73.3 cents and 98 cents a litre respectively. The department of energy said in a statement that the minister has approved a net increase of 3.9 cents per litre in the annual margin adjustments on petrol and a net decrease of 0.7 cents per litre on diesel and illuminating paraffin wholesale prices, in line with the application of the Regulatory Accounts System. This is effective from Wednesday (6 December). It said that the average international product prices of petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin increased during the period under review. And this while the rand depreciated against the US dollar, with the average ZAR/USD exchange rate for the period 27 October to 30 November 2017 weakening to R14.0964/$, compared with R13.6210 against the US currency in the previous comparable period. “This led to a higher contribution to the Basic Fuels Price on petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin by 23.15 cents per litre, 23.03 cents per litre and 23.34 cents per litre respectively,” the department said.
