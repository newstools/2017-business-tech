Huawei has announced that it will launch a localised app store in Africa. The app store will be pre-installed on Huawei devices and will include a variety of content. “Huawei’s consumer mobile services in Africa will include an app store for locally-developed games, music, movies, books, and other content,” the company said. “We are also planning to launch African themes and cloud storage.” Huawei said its app store is not aiming to compete with Google Play, but will supplement existing Android apps. The company is working with partners in Africa to offer locally-developed apps and mobile games. Huawei supports various carriers to offer digital content across Africa, such as MTN’s music and gaming platform. Read: Liquid partners with Huawei to deliver 100G upgrades to its SA network
