As we prepare to wind down in anticipation of the festive period, it is important not to let your guard down on the road, especially given the surge in hijackings in the country over the past year amid a depressed economy. The Automobile Association has warned motorists in South Africa that criminals are more likely to target those who aren’t paying attention – and not let your guard down. As such vehicle tracking app Pro-Active South Africa has published a series of maps showing the worst hijacking and crime hotspots in the country’s three largest metropolitan areas of Joburg, Pretoria and Cape Town. Pro-Active said that the theft of motor vehicles/organized crime is a profession like any other and the criminals are engaging in the activities for monetary benefit. Using data based on published information by the SAPS, tracking companies, and Insurance Crime Bureau, the application has mapped out the areas where people need to be most vigilant.
