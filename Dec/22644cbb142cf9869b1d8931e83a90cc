A battle for the National Prosecuting Authority is coming, as both sides of a recent court decision to set aside the appointment of NPA head Shaun Abrahams plan their next move. On Friday, 8 December, the High Court ruled that Abrahams’ appointment should be set aside, and that a new national director should be appointed by deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa. The court found that Abrahams was biased in cases relating to president Jacob Zuma. However, according to a report by the City Press, reaction to the ruling has been divided – with Zuma and Abrahams supporters saying that the court has overstepped its role with the ruling. Anticipating this, the legal teams of the civil groups who pushed the case are now planning to apply for direct access to the Constitutional Court to back up the High Court ruling, as it is evident that this is where the matter will end up. They seek to avoid a drawn out process, and to skip the delaying tactics that president Zuma has employed in the past to drag out any legal matters where he is implicated. President Zuma and the NPA plan on appealing the ruling. You can read the full story in the City Press Read: Abrahams faces suspension over Gordhan charges
