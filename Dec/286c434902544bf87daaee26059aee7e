The Foschini Group (TFG) has rolled out its in-store collection service for online purchases to 184 stores across the country. The service was initially being run on a trial basis in Cape Town for the last six months, and has proven successful enough to scale it up to other provinces, it said. The click-and-collect service allows customers to shop full ranges on the TFG website (across all stores), and then pick up purchases at their nearest @home, Foschini, Markham, Sportscene or Totalsports within eight days. “Collect in Store provides access to online shopping to people who do not have a delivery address during office hours. They can buy fragrances from Foschini for Beauty online, but collect the item at a Totalsports store near their place of employment during their lunch hour or during their daily work commute,” the group said. Research conducted during the trial period also showed that between 15% and 20% of customers collecting in store went on to purchase other goods in the bricks stores, presenting an opportunity for sales people to up sell their goods to online shoppers. “Besides nullifying the need for a physical delivery address when shopping across TFG’s online stores, Collect In Store has many benefits including: the option to exchange an item immediately should the customer be dissatisfied, giving the shopper access to a broader range of goods online than in-stores, and the flexibility to collect goods ordered at a time and store that is convenient,” TFG said. The collect in store service is entirely free, with no qualifying amount required. Read: TFG next to be nailed for charging unlawful club fees
