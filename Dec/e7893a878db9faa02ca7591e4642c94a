With holidays around the corner many South Africans are already planning out their beach trips with the family. Historically South Africans have looked at everything from hotels, to caravans for their seaside trips but the rise of apps such as Airbnb means it has become increasingly easier for families to simply book a couple of days ahead with an app, and rest assured they will have a fully-furnished apartment or home waiting for them.
