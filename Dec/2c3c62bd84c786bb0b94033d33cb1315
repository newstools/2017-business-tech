Google has launched its new Files Go Android app, which can free up storage space and improve file storage on smartphones. Files Go reduces storage wastage by suggesting files to delete, such as unused applications, low-resolution videos, or duplicate files. The app also organises images, videos, apps, and documents automatically, removing the need to navigate through traditional folder structures. Users can also back up files to the cloud or transfer files to other devices using Files Go. According to Google, the average Android user saves around 1GB per month of storage thanks to Files Go. Files Go is available from the Google Play Store. Read: Google launches data-saving app in South Africa
