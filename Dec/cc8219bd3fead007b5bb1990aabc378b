The South African Post Office could soon be granted a full state bank licence before it begins distributing social grants in April 2018. This is according to ANC committee on communications head Jackson Mthembu who was speaking at a briefing on policy matters in the run-up to the ruling party’s 54th national conference next week, reports The Mercury. “The South African Post Office has been stabilised with adequate capacity at management and board level,” he said. “We have further made significant progress to license the Post Bank as a fully-fledged state bank and expect this process to be completed soon. We welcome the decision that the Post Bank will become the primary distributor of social grants from April 2018.” Mthembu further called on government, as a whole, to “move with speed” to ensure that the Post Bank shall be first choice for government and the primary platform for government and citizens’ transactions. He said that he plans to present a  proposal to the ANC national conference next weekend to ensure that all government spheres, including provincial and local governments, should use the Post Bank as their bank of choice.
