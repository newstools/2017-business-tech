Here’s what is happening in and affecting South Africa today: 
The presidency has denied any knowledge of a new draft of the country’s state of emergency laws, which will reportedly allow government to cut all communication and make arrests without a warrant. Meanwhile, former state security minister David Mahlobo says that the government will “address” the continued leaking of confidential information.
 
Steinhoff’s moves to do damage control – such as establishing a subcommittee of independent directors to investigate the latest scandal – has done little to resolve concerns around the company. Analysts and investors say that the independent directors were already on the board and had already failed to govern properly.
 
Analysts believe the ANC is heading for a split, with the chances higher now than ever before in the party’s history. Despite both Ramaphosa and Dlamini-Zuma calling for unity after the coming conference, many analysts believe Ramaphosa’s supporters will forge their own path, should the deputy president not succeed Zuma as leader.
 
The NPA has again dismissed allegations that Shaun Abrahams is a ‘Zuma puppet’, after Abrahams acceded to the president’s request for a deadline extension to allow him to make representations why he shouldn’t face 783 corruption charges. The High Court ruled last week that Abrahams should vacate his office and a new NDPP should be appointed.
 
South Africa’s rand firmed against the dollar on Monday as the greenback retreated, while a recovery of Steinhoff’s shares following a week of turmoil at the global retailer lifted blue chip stocks. On Tuesday, the rand was at R13.64 to the dollar, R18.21 to the pound and R16.05 to the euro.
